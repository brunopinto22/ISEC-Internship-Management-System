# ISEC Internship and Project Partnerships Management System

This project was developed as the final degree project for my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering at Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra (ISEC). It aims to provide a centralized digital platform that manages and monitors partnerships between ISEC and external companies, covering the entire process from internship and research project proposals to student applications and placements.


## 🎯 Motivation

The management of internships and project partnerships at ISEC has traditionally been handled in a fragmented way, which can make accessing relevant information and maintaining administrative efficiency challenging. This project was developed to address these issues by proposing a unified and streamlined solution aimed at improving communication, oversight, and transparency among students, academic staff, and partner organizations. While the system is designed with these goals in mind, its adoption and use within the institution will depend on future decisions and evaluations.


## 🏗️ Project Structure

The system is composed of two main applications:

- **Backend API**: A RESTful API responsible for data management, user authentication, and business logic.
- **Frontend Application**: A web interface that communicates with the API, providing different dashboards and functionalities tailored to various user roles.

This separation allows for a clear division between data handling and user interaction, facilitating maintainability and scalability.


## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- Frontend: [React](https://reactjs.org/), HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
- Backend: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), Python
- Design: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)


## 📚 Documentation

The complete and detailed project report, covering all aspects of the development process, architecture, and conclusions, is available in the `/docs` directory.
